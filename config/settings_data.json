To make things more complicated than they should be, especially for MTB riders, tyre manufacturers often overstate their tyre sizes. For example, a tyre stated to be 2.4” will often measure 2.2”. If that's the case, please go for the CLUG mtb (rather than the CLUG mtb XL) as you will appreciate the snugger fit. The easiest way to measure tyre width is with callipers.",

Have a look on our CLUG page to work out which size CLUG you need. If your tyre states its 2.3” or 2.4” then it will very likely have an actual size of around 2.2” and we strongly recommend you opt for the CLUG mtb size.",

              "faq_desc_1": "<p>CLUG is the world’s smallest bike rack and works with your floor to store your bike. You can CLUG vertically or horizontally.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_2": "Which size CLUG do I need?",
              "faq_desc_2": "<p>The critical measurement is your ACTUAL tyre width. Armed with this measurement pick CLUG with the appropriate range. To make things more complicated than they should be, especially for MTB riders, tyre manufacturers often overstate their tyre sizes. For example, a tyre stated to be 2.4” will often measure 2.2”. If that&#x27;s the case, please go for the CLUG mtb (rather than the CLUG mtb XL) as you will appreciate the snugger fit. The easiest way to measure tyre width is with callipers. Visit the &#x27;<a href=\"\/pages\/video-library\" title=\"Video Library\">Videos<\/a>&#x27; section to find out how to measure.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_3": "How is it best to store my bike using CLUG?",
              "faq_desc_3": "<p>CLUG is designed to store your bike vertically or horizontally, depending on your space. CLUG should always sit just above the mid-point of the wheel.  <br\/><br\/><br\/>When using CLUG for vertical storage, this helps to keep your handlebars straight. Roll the bike into an upright position so that the rear wheel is resting on the floor (which should be stable and flat!) against the wall vertically beneath the CLUG. Then line up the front tyre so that it rests against the jaws of the CLUG before giving it a good nudge into the CLUG.  Please note that you cannot store a bike vertically with CLUG if the front wheel is on the floor because it will swivel, and the bike will fall! <br\/><br\/><br\/>For horizontal storage, the rear wheel is reversed into the CLUG, just above the mid-point of the wheel, ensuring that the bike is perfectly straight.  Please note that when using CLUG for horizontal storage you cannot &#x27;clug&#x27; the front tyre because it will swivel. CLUG might be clever but it can&#x27;t be expected to hold a bike upright if it is mounted to the floor instead of the wall!&quot;<\/p>",
              "faq_question_4": "Can CLUG hang my bike in the air with it's wheels off the ground??",
              "faq_desc_4": "<p>No, please note that CLUG cannot hang your bike, it doesn&#x27;t work that way. CLUG works with your floor to store your bike. That said CLUG has been used by the likes of Schwalbe and Profile Design to store spare wheels neatly and accessibly.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_5": "If I change tyres do I need a whole new CLUG or can I just switch the inner gripper",
              "faq_desc_5": "<p>Each CLUG size has a gripper that uniquely matches it&#x27;s clipper, so they cannot be interchanged.  Each CLUG size accommodates a range of tyre widths so, unless the width difference is significant, you may not need to switch CLUG sizes.  The CLUG mtb and CLUG mtb XL sizes share the same screw footprint so if you are switching between different size mtb tyres you won&#x27;t need to drill any more holes in the wall.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_6": "Do I need two CLUGs - for the front and back wheels?",
              "faq_desc_6": "<p>No! 1 CLUG does the job just fine.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_7": "What sizes are there?",
              "faq_desc_7": "<p>CLUG comes in 5 different sizes, accommodating all tyre widths between 23mm (1&quot;) to 81mm (3.2&quot;).  Take a look at our ‘<a href=\"https:\/\/hornit.com\/collections\/clug\" title=\"https:\/\/hornit.com\/collections\/clug\">Bike Storage<\/a>’ section to see which size you need for your tyre. If your tyre width sits in the middle of two CLUG sizes, we advise you to go with the smaller size CLUG. A tight fit is a good fit!  Note, if your tyre width is 2.3 - 2.4&quot; you will find the CLUG mtb a securer fit than the CLUG mtb XL.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_8": "I ordered a CLUG using your measurement guidelines for actual tyre width but it looks too small for my tyre?",
              "faq_desc_8": "<p>If your tyre is at the top of the width range that your CLUG size accommodates, you will need to mount the CLUG to the wall in order to have enough pressure behind the bike to push the tyre into it.  Not an easy feat with CLUG in hand! A tight fit is a secure fit, but if you’re not sure please contact us at info@thehornit.com and we’ll be able to advise you whether or not you need to swap it for a larger size CLUG.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_9": "What size drill bit do I use for the wall plug?",
              "faq_desc_9": "<p>Roadie and Hybrid : 1\/4&quot; or 6mm.<br\/>mtb, mtb XL and mtb plus : 5\/16&quot; or 8mm.<\/p>",

              "faq_desc_10": "<p>Unfortunately tape won’t work as it is not strong enough.

              "faq_question_11": "Can I use the CLUG to store my e-bike?",
              "faq_desc_11": "<p>CLUG is officially tested on bikes up to 13kg for the roadie and 20kg for all the other sizes. E-bikes tend to be 25kg so we cannot officially recommend it. Unofficially, if your e-bike tyre is an mtb tyre and is towards the upper end of the size range for the CLUG then it will be fine as there is a lot of friction holding it in place.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_12": "Will CLUG cause damage to carbon fibre rims?",
              "faq_desc_12": "<p>Good question! Basically CLUG will mark your carbon rims if the plastic touches the rim (which obviously none of us want to happen). To solve this, set the CLUG a couple of inches higher than the mid-point of the wheel so that CLUG still fully grips the tyre, but the arms are not long enough to touch the carbon rim. It can be tricky to get absolutely right first time so may require you to re-drill the holes. We know this works because there is a wall of Argon 18 bikes displayed in this way at the Argon 18 HQ!<\/p>",
              "faq_question_13": "Is CLUG compatible with Clincher tyres?",
              "faq_desc_13": "<p>CLUG was born before the advent of high end, wide carbon rims and straight-walled tyres. Usually CLUG pinches the narrow part of the tyre by the rim and the tyre fills the inner part of the CLUG, but with clinchers the tyre wall tends to be straight, not rounded. It still grips because clincher tyres are almost always at the upper end of the roadie parameters.<br\/><br\/>One word of caution, please be sure you do not have a slow puncture as it would be awful if CLUG let go. We will have a special strap launching in late 2021 for complete peace of mind.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_14": "Can I store my bike vertically if my bike has hydraulic brakes?",
              "faq_desc_14": "<p>Yes you can! Don&#x27;t listen to the naysayers on this! Hydraulic brakes use liquid (either DOT fluid or mineral oil). The reason some people think this is an issue is because if there is air in the hydraulic brake system, it may cause soft brakes (meaning the brake lever can be pulled in all the way instead of having a firm and immediate response). <br\/>However, the only reason this happens is if the brakes have not been properly bled, which potentially causes air bubbles in the hydraulic system. It is NOT the fault of the storage method or the brakes, but the fault of the person who bled the brakes poorly! Worst case should be that after a few pumps of the brakes the pressure will be back to normal again.<br\/>Still not convinced? We are aware of some forum posts e.g. from someone who has multiple mountain bikes who claims that their brakes behave differently (depending on brand) even though they are all stored vertically in the same way using CLUG. In other words, it is possible that there are a few brake systems with lesser quality seals that don’t respond well, but for the vast majority it is no problem at all. Either the brakes need bleeding properly or a further explanation would be that the more expensive braking systems have better seals. Cheap brakes with poor seals may leak more readily whether hung horizontally or vertically.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_15": "What if my tyre has a slow puncture?",
              "faq_desc_15": "<p>CLUG works by gripping your tyre so punctures will cause CLUG to let go (especially for the roadie and hybrid sizes). For the mtb and plus sizes, as long as your tyre is not at the bottom end of the width-range that the CLUG accommodates, then the tyre wall usually keeps its shape sufficiently for your bike to remain secure. We suggest that you check your tyres regularly to avoid this happening. We will have a special (retro-fittable) strap launching in mid 2021 for long term storage and complete peace of mind.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_16": "My tyre width is in the middle of two different sized CLUGS.  Which one should I go for?",
              "faq_desc_16": "<p>Please remember to measure your ACTUAL tyre size as this may well vary significantly from the stated size. We recommend going for a tighter fit as your bike will be more secure. In particular, if your tyre states it’s a  2.3” or 2.4” tyre, then it will very likely have an actual size of around 2.2” and we strongly recommend you opt for the CLUG mtb size, not the CLUG mtb XL.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_17": "Can CLUG stretch over time?",
              "faq_desc_17": "<p>CLUGs are made from a composite plastic polymer which has a great memory. They are made to return to their original size\/shape when the tyre is removed so this is not a problem you will have. The only scenario this might be an issue is if you store 27-32mm tyres in a CLUG roadie for a long time then switch to 23mm tyres.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_18": "I’m planning on buying a new bike, can I move my CLUG?",
              "faq_desc_18": "<p>Yes! If you are planning on drilling into anything that isn’t wood, you will need to get some new wall plugs. All you need to do is take out the plastic gripper that is covering the screws and unscrew the clipper. If you are drilling straight into wood then you wouldn’t need to find new wall plugs, you can just unscrew the screws and use them again.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_19": "I’ve bought the wrong size CLUG. Can I return \/ exchange it?",
              "faq_desc_19": "<p>If you email us at info@thehornit.com, we will gladly help you to sort out an exchange.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_20": "My rear wheel is dirtying my wall, how can I prevent this from happening?",
              "faq_desc_20": "<p>All good things come to those who wait. We’ve designed a wipe clean, re-usable mud pad that we expect to launch in the mid\/late 2021. The special micro-suction pad can be removed and re-used and won&#x27;t pull off your paint.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_21": "Can I rely on the tyre size stated on the tyre?",
              "faq_desc_21": "<p>Sadly not! Road tyre stated sizes do tend to be accurate. However, when it comes to MTB tyres manufacturers almost always exaggerate the size by as much as 0.1-0.2”. This is why you should go by ACTUAL tyre size, not the stated tyre size, especially if you are at the upper or lower limit of a given CLUG size. In practice if a tyre is stated to be 2.3-2.4” it will probably measure 2.1-2.25”. This means that you should definitely go for the CLUG mtb (rather than the CLUG mtb XL) to ensure a snug fit – the mtb XL will be loose.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_22": "Can I mount CLUG on drywall?",
              "faq_desc_22": "<p>If you have a roadie or hybrid size, the answer is yes you can. Please use the patented Toggler wall plugs supplied. We go to great lengths to source these from the USA as they are the best we have found. If you have the mtb, mtb XL or the plus size then the answer is no. The reason is that larger, ‘nobblier’ mountain bike tyres exert a much greater pull force on the CLUG and the dry wall is unlikely to cope.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_23": "Can I mount CLUG at an angle?",
              "faq_desc_23": "<p>You can if you are a DIY guru! You need to create an attachment between the wall and CLUG at the required angle and don’t forget to make a block for your bottom tyre to rest against at the same angle. Please note the tyre must fit into the CLUG straight on and not at an angle to be effective.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_24": "How do I fit my CLUG?",
              "faq_desc_24": "<p>Decide whether you want to clug vertically or horizontally. The CLUG should always sit just above (say 25mm or 1”) the centre line of the wheel. When clugging vertically this helps keep your handlebars straight. When clugging horizontally this will help make your bike more stable. Use the drilling guide on the box to drill two holes in the right place. We designed this specially for you and the box will even catch the dust as you drill! Using the screws provided screw the clipper into the holes that you have just made. Then fit the gripper inside the clipper.<\/p>"

              "faq_question_1": "How loud is it?",
              "faq_desc_1": "<p>The Hornit dB140 is 140 decibels making it the world’s loudest bike horn!<\/p>",
              "faq_question_2": "Why is it so loud?",
              "faq_desc_2": "<p>It’s simple. The louder the horn the safer you are: the louder the horn the further away and the more quickly you get a motorist’s or a pedestrian’s attention and the more likely it is to be effective in all road conditions (diesel engines, tyre noise, wind...). And once they know you’re there they won&#x27;t pull out or step out in front of you. All vehicles in the world have a horn by law because it makes drivers and pedestrians safer and yet for some reason the most vulnerable road user of all has historically had to make do with a bell. Being armed with a loud horn ironically makes cycling far less stressful as you know you can make yourself heard when it really matters, fewer road users get in your way, you have to brake less and you don’t have to shout at people.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_3": "Why does it have two different sounds?",
              "faq_desc_3": "<p>The piercing duo-tone sound is designed to be heard through car windows and above the ambient noise. The secondary car-horn &#x27;park mode&#x27; sound it more of a traditional ‘beep’ sound which is less audible on the road but works much better for pedestrians in a park or on a trail. You change the sound mode by pressing the “H” button at the rear of the main unit.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_4": "Why does one of the sounds on the dB140 sound like a tweeting bird?",
              "faq_desc_4": "<p>Some trail riders and mountain bikers have said that the piercing 140dB sound actually sounds like a tweeting bird when they’re riding off-road. On the road it alerts drivers and pedestrians perfectly – they hear a noise and look\/cease the dangerous manoeuvre they are about to carry out because sub-consciously they know they are doing something that’s potentially dangerous. However, in a forest or on a trail, walkers sub-consciously are in their own safe worlds and the piercing mode at a distance can sound like a tweeting bird. For that reason, it’s much better to switch to the car-horn mode as pedestrians will associate the ‘beep’ sound with a vehicle will therefore be much more likely to look round and move out of your way.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_5": "How do pedestrians react?",
              "faq_desc_5": "<p>The great thing about the Hornit dB140 is that you can warn pedestrians a long way in advance. Pedestrians often use their ears as much as their eyes to cross a roads (especially if they are crossing a quiet road), but sub-consciously they are aware that they are potentially in danger. Therefore hearing a piercing sound will immediately cause them to look up and see you. If you alert a pedestrian in advance they can simply continue crossing or step back to let you pass without you having to brake or swerve. If you use a quiet bell or quiet horn or warn them too late, then the pedestrian will likely not look up until you are virtually on top of them and that’s when they freeze and\/or step into your way. It’s helpful to remember that the Hornit is not actually that loud when the sound reaches the pedestrian’s ears so don’t be afraid to use it in advance, giving them time to look up, see you and move calmly out of the way – it won&#x27;t come across as aggressive. That said, you should always be prepared for a pedestrian not to move as you expect and ride accordingly.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_6": "Can I use a New Style Trigger with an Old Style unit?",
              "faq_desc_6": "<p>Unfortunately, an old style unit will only work with old style triggers and vice versa. We updated it to improve reliability. If you have any questions please email us at info@thehornit.com and we will gladly help you out.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_7": "Is it legal?",
              "faq_desc_7": "<p>Yes. There are currently no restrictions governing noise levels of horns on bicycles in the UK, USA, Australia or any of the other 44 countries we distribute our products in. Very few countries have legislated in this area with the exception of Germany. If you have a Hornit dB140 in Germany then be sure to use it off-road only. For some anomalous reason this wonderfully pro-cycling nation has an antiquated law that only bike bells may be used. We are lobbying Angela Merkel.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_8": "Is it safe for my ears?",
              "faq_desc_8": "<p>Yes. The sound of the dB140 is mainly projected forwards. Cyclists will only hear ~100-104dB when in use (which is about the same as going to a rock concert for a few seconds). Clearly it is up to the rider to use the Hornit responsibly and to weigh up the risks of having a crash against any possible ear drum damage.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_9": "Is it safe for children to use?",
              "faq_desc_9": "<p>The dB140 is not a toy and riders under the age of 16 should not use the Hornit due to their more sensitive ears and the increased likelihood of irresponsible use. That said, we strongly believe in letting people decide what risks they want to take so if your child is cycling to school and has to ride on a busy road then we would regard it to be as essential as using a helmet: preventing an accident altogether is preferable to having your head protected in an accident you could have avoided had you been able to warn another road user you were there!

It’s fine to disconnect and leave the trigger on your bike. We cannot guarantee it, but the chances of someone taking a lone wire are negligible.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_12": "How is it powered?",
              "faq_desc_12": "<p>The dB140 is powered by 2 AAA Batteries should last you for up to 18 months with “normal use”. We consider “normal use” to be 6 x 1 second blasts a day 5 days a week. In practice you’re very unlikely to use it this often. It is very easy to change the batteries, simply unscrew the battery cover, change the batteries and screw the cover back on.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_13": "Are the batteries included?",

              "faq_question_14": "Can I use rechargeable batteries?",
              "faq_desc_14": "<p>Unfortunately, rechargeable batteries typically have a lower voltage, meaning that less sound is generated.

              "faq_desc_6": "<p>On a scooter, the child’s hands are much closer together and so a remote trigger isn’t normally needed for their thumbs to safely reach the buttons. However, on a bike, it’s rarely easy to mount the Hornit Mini next to their hands so the trigger enables them to make the selected sound safely (without having to take their hands off the handlebars).<\/p>",
              "faq_question_7": "How bright are the lights?",
              "faq_desc_7": "<p>The lights are 12 lumens, which is the same (and in many cases better) than other safety lights on the market. They are designed to make your child more visible in low light such during winter school runs!<\/p>",
              "faq_question_8": "How does it fit to my bike\/scooter?",
              "faq_desc_8": "<p>The two stretchy wings fit around all bikes and scooter handlebars and will keep the Hornit Mini securely in place. It has been designed so children can mount and remove the Hornit Mini in seconds.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_9": "How strong are the wings?",
              "faq_desc_9": "<p>We know that the combination of the cycling and toy environments mean our products have to be strong. The wings are tested to withstand a dead weight of 10kg weight on them so to break them you have to really want to! That said, rubber can tear easily if it comes into contact with a sharp object so take care to avoid nicks or cuts on the wings.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_10": "What does the ‘sting’ do?",
              "faq_desc_10": "<p>The ‘sting’ button at the rear of the Mini Hornit is the volume button.<br\/>To change the volume, press the sting. The volume cycles through from loud to medium to quiet and round again. The volume setting you are on is indicated by the loudness of the beep sound it makes each time you press it.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_11": "Will it get stolen if I leave it on my bike?",
              "faq_desc_11": "<p>Minis are hot property! We strongly advise that the Hornit Mini is not left unattended on a bike or scooter because it is so easy to remove. If your child rides to school with it, put it in their backpack and let them show their friends! If that isn’t possible then, we recommend taking it off and taking it with you.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_12": "How waterproof is it?",
              "faq_desc_12": "<p>The Hornit Mini will be fine in light rain and possibly even heavy rain provided that the water doesn’t get into the internal parts (through the lens). If it is raining, we recommend that the front is tilted down slightly so that water can’t get inside. The speaker does actually work underwater (we discovered that during testing), however the other internal parts may malfunction after getting wet. Try shaking out any excess water if anything gets inside. Water damage isn’t covered by our warranty so try and avoid letting kids use it as a submarine in puddles!<\/p>",
              "faq_question_13": "How durable is the Hornit Mini?",
              "faq_desc_13": "<p>For peace of mind we give a 2 year warranty. We have tested the Hornit Mini in extreme weather (simulated in ovens and freezers), subjected it to wear and tear tests and generally put it through its paces. The wings can withstand a 10kg deadweight attached to them, and all units tested worked after being dropped from 5m up onto concrete. The trigger should be treated with care. Make sure your children aren’t using it as a rope swing as it can only support up to 1kg before snapping!<\/p>",
              "faq_question_14": "Can I buy one in the shops?",
              "faq_desc_14": "<p>The product is available in multiple stores in the UK, USA, Europe and across the world.

              "faq_question_2": "What do the sizes mean?",
              "faq_desc_2": "<p>The measurement (in cm) refers to the circumference around the largest part of the rider’s head (approximately 1cm above the rider’s eyebrows). Our helmets generally fit children aged 3+. This isn’t a rule though – actual sizing is critical - so please measure up!  Check our sizing guide on the helmet product pages!<\/p>",
              "faq_question_3": "How do I measure my child’s head to check for the right size?",
              "faq_desc_3": "<p>We have written a handy article about how exactly to measure your kids head. Head over to our &#x27;Blog&#x27; section to check it out.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_4": "Are the helmets adjustable?",
              "faq_desc_4": "<p>Yes! We have a ring adjuster at the back of the helmet (with an integrated LED light) which tightens and loosens to ensure the helmet fits snuggly to you’re the rider’s head. The straps that clip under the chin are also adjustable. The ring adjuster should be tightened until the fit is firm but comfortable and the chin strap should fit snugly under the chin.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_5": "My child has had a fall and hit their helmet on the ground - can I still use it?",
              "faq_desc_5": "<p>No. If the helmet has suffered an impact (even if there is no visible damage), or when it shows obvious signs of wear and tear, you should discard and replace it. It is recommended that helmets are replaced after 4-5 years after initial use or within 8 years of production.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_6": "The batteries in my LED light have stopped working, what do I do?",
              "faq_desc_6": "<p>If your LED light at the back of the helmet has stopped working, then it almost certainly needs new batteries. Unscrew the two small screws and put in 2 new AG3 batteries or 1 new CR2032 battery depending on which LED you have. If this doesn’t fix the problem, then Contact Us and we will help!<\/p>",
              "faq_question_7": "The helmet does not fit my child’s head very well, what should I do?",
              "faq_desc_7": "<p>It can happen, not all head shapes are the same and while our helmet is designed to fit as many heads as possible, for some it might not work. It is really important that the helmet is a good fit. We’d far rather you protected your child’s head properly so will happily accept returns for a full refund.<\/p>",

The decibel range is 75-80dB.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_2": "Why don’t you make it louder?",
              "faq_desc_2": "<p>It’s a toy! The Nano (and Mini) use a speaker rather than a piezo buzzer so the volume is necessarily restricted by the speaker capacity. In addition, the Hornit Nano is toy-tested to make it safe for children’s sensitive ears. The Hornit Nano isn’t made for safety when cycling or scootering on main roads. Children love to let their imaginations run wild when they use it pretending to be racing cars, animals, emergency vehicles etc. so it doesn’t need to be loud!<\/p>",
              "faq_question_3": "How long is battery life?",
              "faq_desc_3": "<p>This clearly varies depending on use. The 2x AAA batteries last for up to 17 hours 45 minutes on a constant light mode and up to 58 hours on flashing mode.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_4": "What are the sounds effects on the Hornit Nano?",
              "faq_desc_4": "<p>On the Nano there are 15 different sound effects. These are:<br\/>Bike Bell, Hooter, Ole Trumpet, Dixie Horn, Racing Cars, Laser, Firework, Police Car, Burp, Fart, Magic Spell, Magic Carpet, Wolf, Train, Reversing Truck. We have tried to make the sound effects as fun and realistic as possible, to help kids imaginations run free!<\/p>",
              "faq_question_5": "Why is there a remote trigger on the Hornit Mini, but not the Hornit Nano?",
              "faq_desc_5": "<p>The Nano is primarily aimed the scooter riders because your child’s hands will be right next to where the Nano mounts on the handlebars. The Hornit Mini was designed for both scooters and bikes, meaning your child can mount the larger Hornit Mini anywhere towards the middle of the handlebars and make the selected sound without having to take their hands off the handlebars. The Nano is still an option for bikes as it’s narrower than the Mini and can be mounted on the handlebar grip.<\/p>",
              "faq_question_6": "Can I use the trigger for the Hornit Mini on the Hornit Nano?",
              "faq_desc_6": "<p>Unfortunately not. If it’s a trigger set up you want then go for the Mini!<\/p>",
              "faq_question_7": "How bright are the lights?",
              "faq_desc_7": "<p>The 3 light settings are 6 lumens which is less than the Mini, but it means the batteries last a lot longer (58 hours in our tests as opposed to 12 hours for the Mini). If you are looking for a brighter children’s light, then have a look at our Hornit Mini which has a 12 lumen light. Both the Nano and Mini are designed to make your child more visible in low light conditions such as early mornings or evenings and the winter school run!<\/p>",

They will use their feet. We debated at length whether to have one (essentially to make the parents feel better), but resisted because it gives parents a false sense of security, ironically making the child less safe. Ideally balance bikes should not be used anywhere where brakes are needed and not having a brake makes that more likely.<\/p>",

It should be finger tight (to eliminate play in the headset). Be careful not to over tighten as it should not restrict the steering: the handlebars should turn freely.

Tom spent 7 years commuting to work in London and saw a gap in the market for innovative cycling products. When the brand launched in 2012, the objective was to create pioneering accessories that make cycling safer without compromising style. The first product to launch was the dB140 - the world’s loudest bike horn. The horn enables cyclists to alert distracted drivers and pedestrians to their presence and the sleek design means is blends seamlessly with any bike.",
